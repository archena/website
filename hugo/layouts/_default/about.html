          <p>With a background in DevOps and SRE, Tom not only has a wealth of experience engineering
            reliable production environments, but as the lead guitarist in his band, he's a literal
            DevOps rockstar. He's worked with many prominent tech clients, most recently leading efforts
            to deploy large-scale data processing infrastructure in Kubernetes for Disney Streaming
            Services.</p>

          <p>When he's not doing rockstar DevOps or building cool stuff in the cloud, Tom's a commited
            mountain biker with an intimidating training regime.</p>

          <p>Tom uses <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a>.</p>

          <p>Hailing from the city of Kurgan on the edge of Siberia in Russia, Mikhail Iakovlev (Misha) studied computer science at the University of Manchester and went on to study a masters in bioinformatics and theoretical systems biology at Imperial College London, where he worked on the <a href="http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~missense3d">Missense3D project</a> for protein structure prediction. He's also two-time finalist at <a href="https://www.hac100.com">Hack Manchester<a/>. Misha is a full-stack engineer and data scientist with a deep-seated passion for technology.</p>

          <p>In his spare time Misha unwinds by hacking with infosec tools and playing his electronic drum kit. Weekends are often spent at his local village and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacha">Dacha</a> hanging out with friends and enjoying burgers on the BBQ.
