            </div>
            <p>With a background in DevOps and SRE, Tom not only has a wealth of experience engineering
              reliable production environments, but as the lead guitarist in his band, he's a literal
              DevOps rockstar. He's worked with many prominent tech clients, most recently leading efforts
              to deploy large-scale data processing infrastructure in Kubernetes for Disney Streaming
              Services.</p>

            <p>When he's not doing rockstar DevOps or building cool stuff in the cloud, Tom's a commited
              mountain biker with an intimidating training regime.</p>

            <p>Tom uses <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a>.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Matt has spent his career building distributed and reactive software using Scala, Akka and
              Kafka in
              many domains including advertising, price comparison, biometrics, and IoT applications. His
              background is in natural computation, a field of computer science that studies how living
              things
              compute, to think about new ways to make machines smarter.</p>

            <p>Before starting Fuzzy Labs Matt was technical team lead at Disney Streaming Services, where
              he worked
              on a machine learning project to predict customer happiness based on their experience of
              using the
              Disney+ platform. In his spare time he likes to dabble in building hardware, cooking
              curries,
              exploring mountains and learning Mandarin.</p>

            <p>Matt uses <a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs">Emacs</a>.</p>

            </div>

            <p>
              Hailing from the Kurgan, near Yekaterinburg in Russia, Mikhail Iakovlev (Misha) studied computer science at the University of Manchester and went on to study a masters in bioinformatics and theoretical systems biology at Imperial College London, where he worked on the <a href="http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~missense3d">Missense3D project</a> for protein structure prediction. He's also two-time finalist at <a href="https://www.hac100.com">Hack Manchester<a/>. Misha is a full-stack engineer and data scientist with a deep-seated passion for technology.              
            </p>

            <p>
              In his spare time Misha unwinds by hacking with infosec tools and playing his electronic drum kit. Weekends are often spent at his local village and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacha">Dacha</a> hanging out with friends and enjoying burgers on the BBQ. We imagine itâ€™s a bit like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4kzBmmGyhA&t=3s">this</a>.
