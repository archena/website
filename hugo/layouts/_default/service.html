    <p>Successful marketing depends on reaching people and cultivating relationships. Today's consumers interact
      with businesses across a wide range of Internet-connected devices, and every interaction generates data.</p>

    <p>AI helps us make sense of this data:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customer segmentation</strong> finds groups of customers that share common attributes such as
        their age, job or purchasing habits.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Repeat-buyer prediction</strong> helps you convert one-time customers into repeat customers by
        looking at what drives their purchase decisions.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Hyper-personalisation</strong> presents customers with targeted product recommendations.</li>

      <li><strong>Sentiment analysis</strong> gives you insights into public opinion by looking at social media
        activity.
      </li>
    </ul>

        <p>In many businesses a lot of time is spent on processing documents and inputting or copying data. By
          putting
          AI in the right places we can automate the most laborious parts of these business processes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Optical character recognition</strong> extracts the text from a paper document so that
            it can be
            stored and used for further processing.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Text analysis</strong> enables us to automatically understand the content of a document
            like a
            letter or an email and decide what to do with it.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Entity analysis</strong> looks for key information in a document such as a name, address
            or
            reference number.
