        <h2>Marketing</h2>

        <p>Successful marketing depends on reaching people and cultivating relationships. Today's consumers interact
            with businesses across a wide range of Internet-connected devices, and every interaction generates data.</p>

        <p>AI helps us make sense of this data:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customer segmentation</strong> finds groups of customers that share common attributes such as
                their age, job or purchasing habits.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Repeat-buyer prediction</strong> helps you convert one-time customers into repeat customers by
                looking at what drives their purchase decisions.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Hyper-personalisation</strong> presents customers with targeted product recommendations.</li>

            <li><strong>Sentiment analysis</strong> gives you insights into public opinion by looking at social media
                activity.
            </li>
        </ul>

                <p>In many businesses a lot of time is spent on processing documents and inputting or copying data. By
                    putting
                    AI in the right places we can automate the most laborious parts of these business processes.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Optical character recognition</strong> extracts the text from a paper document so that
                        it can be
                        stored and used for further processing.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Text analysis</strong> enables us to automatically understand the content of a document
                        like a
                        letter or an email and decide what to do with it.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Entity analysis</strong> looks for key information in a document such as a name, address
                        or
                        reference number.

        <p>AI enables a pro-active approach to business intelligence. AI-driven decision making relies on a combination
            of historical data, machine learning and real-time reporting.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Intelligent insights</strong> help you determine your key customers or highlight problems in
                your supply chain.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Business intelligence reporting</strong> using tools like Google Data Studio and Looker to build
                sophisticated real-time dashboards.

        <p>The ability to anticipate an employer's needs gives recruitment agents an edge. By combining many data
            sources it's possible to build a sophisticated picture of the employment market in order to discover the
            skills and roles that a business needs and the best people to fill them.</p>

        <p>AI is everywhere. Your calendar reads your email so it can update when you book a flight or a hotel, your
            photos app understands whatâ€™s in your photos. We have fitness trackers that give us tailored advice and
            smart assistants in our homes. To make all this possible we need to bring AI to consumer devices.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobile and wearable technology</strong>: by using mobile-optimised machine learning models we
                can put AI directly into smart phone apps and wearables such as smart watches.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Smart sensors</strong> can be used to monitor and automate equipment in a factory or crops on a
                farm.
