metadescription: "With AI, two things really count. Firstly, what your AI model does – the capability it’s trained for, for example recognising images, or tracking movement. Secondly, where and how that capability is deployed. Edge computing runs the power of the AI model right where you need it – in your hardware or device. Why? For faster, powerful, portable and secure processing."

   copy: "<h3>The edge of what?</h3><p>AI models can be trained to do all kinds of smart things. The Cloud offers huge processing power for model training, but edge computing pushes the boundaries of what’s possible even further.
</p><p>On the edge, the AI capability is combined with the physical device or hardware itself - no more sending information elsewhere. Using super low-cost solutions like the powerful but compact NVIDIA Jetson Nano, edge computing works upon data in the same location where it’s gathered. It means no time lags, no outages, no bandwidth limitations, but still all the powerful processing benefits you’d expect from the Cloud.
</p><p>The applications are obvious in sectors like healthcare. Image classification, real-time object detection, speech and pressure monitoring – you name it. If you can imagine it, it’s likely that edge AI can make it work better.
</p><p>We’re working with new generation hardware through our partnership with AI accelerators NVIDIA, deploying AI models to edge and IoT devices in innovative ways. Sensors, wearables, trackers, microcontrollers and more – edge computing makes it all faster, more reliable and much more secure.</p>"

      heading: "Develop smarter portable devices"
      description: "We work with tiny hardware units (like Arduino) which can easily be embedded in portable AI enabled devices. In medical technology, wearables, and smart vehicles this is a game changer – new generation edge devices don’t rely on cumbersome fixed monitoring systems, or lots of battery power. Imagine an AI sensor working just as well on the move as within a fixed infrastructure like a hospital – that’s the power of the edge."

      heading: "Faster, more reliable capabilities"
      description: "When data doesn’t have to be sent over the internet to analyse and act upon it you get faster results, consistently, and regardless of connectivity. Edge computing allows a device itself to react instantaneously to real-time events. There’s no latency. It’s more efficient. This means that end user experiences are ultimately improved. Imagine the possibilities when every second counts - no lag between monitoring and medicine, or being able to get instant image classification by smarter security cameras. It’s all possible on the edge."

      heading: "Enhanced privacy and security control"
      description: "Using the cloud for AI processing requires transmitting potentially sensitive data over the internet. Edge computing can remove overheads for the often huge privacy and security infrastructure this requires. Whether it’s patient medical records, or simply the facial recognition image used to unlock your phone, edge computing stores and acts upon this data locally. The analytical power is still there, but privacy is never compromised."
