### About Matt
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-squire-a19896125"><img src="/images/matt-square-thumb.jpg"></a>

Matt has spent his career building distributed and reactive software using Scala, Akka and Kafka in many domains including advertising, price comparison, biometrics, and IoT applications. He's a fan of property-based testing, microservices, and message-driven architecture and he likes to use his background in natural computation, a field of computer science that studies how living things compute, to understand how distributed systems work at scale. Before starting Fuzzy Labs Matt was technical team lead at Disney Streaming Services, building Disney's video-on-demand service Disney+ where he worked on a machine learning project to predict when customers are happy or unhappy based on their experience of using the platform. Likes to dabble in a lot of things, including building hardware, cooking curries, exploring mountains and learning Mandarin.

Matt uses [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/).
