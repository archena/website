Co-Founded by Matt Squire and Tom Stockton in the heart of Manchester, UK. We have 35 years commercial experience in writing
and deploying world-class, modern, scalable software and data systems. We have worked with organisations including
Disney Streaming Services, MoneySupermarket, Booking.com and McLaren. 

We formed Fuzzy Labs with the aim of taking our experience of building high end systems and applying
it to implementing AI solutions for organisations.

### About Matt
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-squire-a19896125/"><img src=/images/matt-square-thumb.jpg alt=""></a>

Not to be confused with the [music producer](https://www.mattsquire.com), although he did once receive an email from the singer [Kesha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesha) but unfortunately she was in need of musical guidance rather than a machine learning algorithm.

Matt has spent his career building distributed and reactive software using Scala, Akka and Kafka in many domains including advertising, price comparison, biometrics, and IoT applications. He's a fan of property-based testing, microservices, and message-driven architecture and he likes to use his background in natural computation, a field of computer science that studies how living things compute, to understand how distributed systems work at scale. Before starting Fuzzy Labs Matt was technical team lead at Disney Streaming Services (building Disney's version of Netflix) which was where he developed his love of data and AI. The final project that he led was a machine learning system that would predict the happiness of customers based on their experience of using the platform.

Matt has read more books than most people and probably speaks more languages too. He's self taught in Russian, French, German and is currently learning Mandarin. His ideal day would probably consist of a Peak District walk with his girlfried and their dogs, then he would whip up a mean veggie curry before whiling away the evening hacking away on IoT hardware (with his Mandarin speaking group) whilst drinking Taiwanese whiskey.

Matt uses [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/).
