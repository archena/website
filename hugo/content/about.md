### About Tom

With a background in DevOps and SRE, Tom not only has a wealth of experience engineering reliable production environments, but as the lead guitarist in his band, he's a literal DevOps rockstar. He's worked with prominent tech clients including MoneySupermaket, Booking.com, McLaren and most recently Disney Streaming Services, where he lead efforts to deploy large-scale data processing infrastructure in Kubernetes.

When he's not doing rockstar DevOps or building cool stuff in the cloud, Tom's a devoted mountain biker with an intimidating training regiment - but the dashcam footage on the descent makes it all worthwhile.

Tom uses [Vim](https://www.vim.org).

### About Matt
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-squire-a19896125"><img src="/images/matt-square-thumb.jpg"></a>

Matt has spent his career building distributed and reactive software using Scala, Akka and Kafka in many domains including advertising, price comparison, biometrics, and IoT applications. He's a fan of property-based testing, microservices, and message-driven architecture and he likes to use his background in natural computation, a field of computer science that studies how living things compute, to think about new ways to make machines smarter.

Before starting Fuzzy Labs Matt was technical team lead at Disney Streaming Services, building Disney's video-on-demand service Disney+ where he worked on a machine learning project to predict when customers are happy or unhappy based on their experience of using the platform. Likes to dabble in a lot of things, including building hardware, cooking curries, exploring mountains and learning Mandarin.

Matt uses [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs).
