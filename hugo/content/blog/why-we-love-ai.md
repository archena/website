Firstly, let’s get one thing clear — we are nerds, not business people. I’d describe us (and Matt would agree) as a couple of keen technologists with a passion for building interesting things, and we love to share our work with anyone who will listen.

That is the [Fuzzy Labs](https://fuzzylabs.ai/) way, and that’s why we created this new blog series!

But before we dive into the fascinating world of technology, let me tell you a little about how it all started…

**How we found our feet**

[Fuzzy Labs](https://fuzzylabs.ai/) started its journey doing projects across a number of different industries, including marketing and FinTech, before entering into the fascinating world of [MedTech.](https://fuzzylabs.ai/ai-for-healthcare/)

It all started with Matt’s feet and a Thursday night hackathon…

During one of our famous, “Hardware, Hacking, Whisky and Mandarin (the language, not the fruit)” nights, Matt had a crazy (but brilliant) idea to try and diagnose a walking condition he had been dealing with at the time.

He decided to [build a shoe insole with sensors that could track the way he was moving.](https://fuzzylabs.ai/blog/ai-for-your-feet/) Then, using AI technology, he correlated the data to try and spot how his posture/movement affected his muscles.

We thought it was a pretty interesting project, so we started to write about it and make some noise in the industry with blogs, vlogs ([which are horrific but hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LQiDVkvdR4&t=1s)) and live examples. Soon, it started to get some real attention.

Off the back of that content, we received an invitation in December 2019 from a FTSE 250 supplier of medical devices to pitch at one of their two-day events for small businesses.

Fortunately, they liked our presentation and, although they didn’t want AI for their feet, they did like the way we worked with technology and wanted to see what we could do with their data.

So, since the start of 2020, we’ve done two big projects with this company which is just one of the things we are really excited to share with you in this upcoming series!

And that’s how [Fuzzy Labs](https://fuzzylabs.ai/) found its feet (no pun intended).

**Our passion for MedTech**

We knew AI could be used in marketing and FinTech (we’d done it before), but we wanted to see how it could be applied in a more scientific setting. At the end of the day, we’re nerds. We’ve got science backgrounds, and we wanted to combine that with our love for technology. This is the world that makes the most sense to us.

When we went to see this medical device supplier in their labs (white coats and all!), we found that we could speak their language better than we could with any marketing or FinTech company we had worked with in the past.

So, we don’t only know how to write the code for this stuff, but we get the science side of things too, which is really exciting!

Our time working with medical devices made us realise that MedTech was our thing, so we looked for opportunities to show people in that space what we could do. For example, last September, we got approached by some PhD students from the National Graphene Institute at the University of Manchester. They had developed this [graphene technology](https://www.graphenetrace.com/) which can be embedded in fabric! After seeing what we did with the “AI for your feet” project, they wanted us to help them implement this technology in the medical sector.

These innovative projects are the kind of thing we want to be talking about in our upcoming blogs, but without too much of the really deep technical stuff. In this series, we want to keep things simple and focus on the software and hardware in a way that anyone can understand!

**AI can make a big difference**

At [Fuzzy Labs](https://fuzzylabs.ai/), we’ve always been more about making a difference than making a lot of money for big corporations. That’s one of the main reasons why we want to take AI technology into the MedTech industry. We believe it can help make a big difference in people’s lives.

But it’s not about replacing the medical professionals and taking their jobs. AI is about assisting medical professionals so they can do their job in a more efficient way by automation and scaling.

Imagine if you could automatically scan every single X-ray and MRI done in the country — what key information could that data provide us with?

We’d be able to pick up trends that we otherwise wouldn’t catch with only humans looking at it, because that scalability goes well beyond what we can manage individually.

For example, you couldn’t have someone follow every patient around with a clipboard, writing down everything they do. But if they’ve got some wearable devices that can track all of these things and feed that data back into an algorithm, then you can start to draw conclusions that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to draw.

And yes, we are going to be talking all about wearable AI devices too!

**For people with an appetite for innovation**

As I mentioned before, the previous blogs we have written have been really technical, aimed at technology junkies like us. However, this series is more aimed at people working in the R&D departments at medical companies and adjacent sectors, who are aware of the need for innovation and have an appetite for it.

But a lot of these decision-makers don’t know how to apply AI, or who to talk to about making it work. We want to help point them in the right direction.
> # The one thing we don’t want to do to is start a big pitch that’s going to cost millions because, the truth is, AI doesn’t have to be expensive or massively complicated.

Through these blogs, we want to show you that these solutions can be low-cost and, once you understand the concept, quite simple to implement.

It just starts by [having a conversation](https://fuzzylabs.ai/#contact) about what your problems are, what data you have, and then [building a simple prototype](https://fuzzylabs.ai/ai-blueprint/) which can show you the potential for technology. Then, once you see it working, you can take that to the next level and roll it out across the business.

**We want to be totally transparent**

The main themes of this series will be:

1. **Education:** Getting you into the right mindset about what is possible with AI.

1. **Building confidence in AI:** Using real-life examples to show you that something can be built and deployed into your business that passes regulations.

In order to accomplish this, we’re going to be covering a whole range of exciting topics such as:

* Why AI is so important today.

* How AI can be applied to MedTech and other related industries.

* How you can adopt AI with very limited tech.

* What you can do to ensure your AI project is a success.

* The future of AI in the medical industry.

* The best companies to speak to about your AI project.

As I told you earlier, we also want to get into some specific user case studies to show you how we are implementing AI today.

We want to be very transparent in these blogs and break down the myths that stuff is very difficult and expensive to implement. Through these case studies, we want to show that it can be done quickly, inexpensively and still have a massive impact on your business and the people you help.

To do that, we’re going to walk you through how we’ve implemented AI in this space, so you can see first hand that this is more than possible — it’s actually pretty simple!

As I mentioned before, we’re not businessmen, just a couple of nerds with a passion for bringing AI into the medical industry!

I hope you will join us on this techie journey.

More to come next week…
