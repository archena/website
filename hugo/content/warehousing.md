   intro: "<p>How much more could you be doing with your data? This was the question we asked our client, Regital, a digital agency specializing in programmatic advertising, when they asked us to help speed up their reporting processes.</p>"
   copy: "<p>We were able to build proof of concept for our client, XpertRule, to help them show how robotic process automation (RPA) could be used to improve efficiency for local government.</p><p>This helped them to secure investment in a wider project to increase overall efficiency for their client, the local council Revenues and Benefits department, who handled benefits claims processing.</p><p>We didn’t just outline what was possible – we built a working demo for XpertRule to use to strengthen their business case, and ultimately secure the work.</p>"
   greenblockHeading: "The challenge"
   greenblockCopy: "<p>The reporting process in question was a central part of the client’s business. After placing programmatic advertising campaigns for their own clients on platforms like Amazon, Facebook and Google, they had to gather huge amounts of data from these platforms to measure the success of the campaign, and present the findings back.</p><p>In order to aggregate and analyse this data at a campaign level – which might include metrics like number of views, clicks, new customers, or sales conversions etc. – the disparate data sources all had to be manually extracted, and transferred into the business in order to build reports. This took, frankly, ages. Every day.</p><p><strong>Surely there was a better way of working?</strong></p>"

   heading: "The solution"
   copy: "<p><strong>We built a cloud based centralized data warehousing solution using Google BigQuery, so all the data they needed was stored in one place.</strong></p><p>Regardless of where the source data came from, the Google BigQuery stored it using a common format, which meant it could be combined, and re-cut in many more ways, giving Regital a much greater reporting capability to offer their advertising clients.</p><p>We wrote code to automatically import the data into the data warehouse, removing all the low value copying the team had previously had to do. Integrating the system with Google Sheets and Google Data Studio meant the team were able to view and use the data in a familiar framework, and now had more time to interpret the results and therefore improve the overall advertising outcomes for their clients.</p>"

   copy: "<p><strong>This might work for you too…</strong></p><p>For a completely data-driven business like Regital, improving the overall efficiency of how that data is imported, stored and used is a game changer. It allowed them not just to add value for their own clients’ advertising campaigns, but also to better understand their own business planning and internal reporting.</p><hr><p>“Working with Matt ad the team at Fuzzy Labs has been a hugely positive experience. Not only have they helped us drive operational efficiencies and enhance our tools, but our minds have been opened to how we leverage cloud platforms to derive value from our data in new, innovative ways. I’ve particularly enjoyed collaborating with Matt, who has both the technical knowhow and the imagination to make pretty much any idea a reality”</p><hr><p>The solution we built for our client is not just great for right now - it’s also future-proof. When (because it is ‘when’, not ‘if’!) new platforms and data sets emerge, they can be easily integrated into the data warehousing solution, which means our client can be confident they’re equipped to cope with change. They’re now in the best position to scale up, offer greater value and generally win at life. (Ok, win at reporting).</p><p>Ultimately, data warehousing means they are equipped to make better business decisions, both now and in the future, and that sounds pretty good to us.</p>"
