We deliver end-to-end software solutions that put AI at the centre. Built on the Google Cloud Platform using modern technology, our solutions are reliable, scalable and agile.

## Marketing

Successful marketing depends on reaching people and cultivating relationships. Today's consumers interact with businesses across a wide range of Internet-connected devices, and every interaction generates data.

AI helps us make sense of this data:

* **Customer segmentation** finds groups of customers that share common attributes such as their age, job or purchasing habits.
* **Repeat-buyer prediction** helps you convert one-time customers into repeat customers by looking at what drives their purchase decisions.
* **Hyper-personalisation** presents customers with targeted product recommendations.
* **Sentiment analysis** gives you insights into public opinion by looking at social media activity.

## Business Process Automation

In many businesses a lot of time is spent on processing documents and inputting or copying data. By putting AI in the right places we can automate the most laborious parts of these business processes.

* **Optical character recognition** extracts the text from a paper document so that it can be stored and used for further processing.
* **Text analysis** enables us to automatically understand the content of a document like a letter or an email and decide what to do with it.
* **Entity analysis** looks for key information in a document such as a name, address or reference number.

Here's a demo of the process in action:

## Business intelligence

AI enables a pro-active approach to business intelligence. AI-driven decision making relies on a combination of historical data, machine learning and real-time reporting.

* **Intelligent insights** help you determine your key customers or highlight problems in your supply chain.
* **Business intelligence reporting** using tools like Google Data Studio and Looker to build sophisticated real-time dashboards.

## Recruitment

The ability to anticipate an employer's needs gives recruitment agents an edge. By combining many data sources it's possible to build a sophisticated picture of the employment market in order to discover the skills and roles that a business needs and the best people to fill them.

## Edge Computing and IoT

AI is everywhere. Your calendar reads your email so it can update when you book a flight or a hotel, your photos app understands whatâ€™s in your photos. We have fitness trackers that give us tailored advice and smart assistants in our homes. To make all this possible we need to bring AI to consumer devices.

* **Mobile and wearable technology**: by using mobile-optimised machine learning models we can put AI directly into smart phone apps and wearables such as smart watches.
* **Smart sensors** can be used to monitor and automate equipment in a factory or crops on a farm.

## Open Source

We use open source software to build our solutions. Some of the technologies we use include Go, Python, Terraform, Docker, Tensorflow, and Jupyter.

We like to contribute back to the open source community. Take a look at our [Github](http://github.com/fuzzylabs) to learn more.
