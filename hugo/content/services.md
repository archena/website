We deliver end-to-end software solutions that put AI at the centre. Built on the Google Cloud Platform using modern technology, our solutions are reliable, scalable and agile.

# Marketing

Successful marketing depends on reaching people and cultivating relationships. Today's consumers interact with businesses across a wide range of Internet-connected devices, and every interaction generates data.

AI helps us make sense of this data:

* **Customer segmentation** finds groups of customers that share common attributes such as their age, job or purchasing habits.
* **Repeat-buyer prediction** helps you convert one-time customers into repeat customers by looking at what drives their purchase decisions.
* **Hyper-personalisation** presents customers with targeted product recommendations.
* **Sentiment analysis** gives you insights into public opinion by looking at social media activity.

# Business Process Automation

By putting AI in the right places we can automate the most laborious parts of a business process, freeing up humans to work on more challenging areas:

* **Optical character recognition** extracts the text from a paper document so that it can be stored and used for further processing.
* **Text analysis** enables us to automatically understand the content of a document like a letter or an email and decide what to do with it.
* **Entity analysis** looks for key information in a document such as a name, address or reference number.
* **Image and media analysis** can categorise and extract key information from photos, videos and audio.

# Recruitment

The ability to anticipate an employer's needs gives recruitment agents an edge. By combining many data sources it's possible to build a sophisticated picture of the employment market in order to discover the skills and roles that a business needs and the best people to fill them.



# Edge Computing and IoT

Nowadays people increasingly interact with AI through mobile devices like phones and watches, as well as smart sensors and home automation systems. All of these things can be managed from the cloud but we also want enable these devices to make their own decisions and continue to operate when an Internet connection isn't available.

* **Mobile and wearable technology**: by using mobile-optimised machine learning models we can put AI directly into smart phone apps and wearables such as smart watches.
* **Smart sensors** can be used to monitor and automated a wide range of processes. For example monitoring equipment in a factory or crops on a farm.

# Open Source

We use open source software to build our solutions. Some of the technologies we use include Go, Python, Terraform, Docker, Tensorflow, and Jupyter.

We like to contribute back to the open source community. Take a look at our [Github](http://github.com/fuzzylabs) to learn more.
