We set up Fuzzy Labs because we wanted build cool AI-driven software, to work with the latest tech, and to flex (and grow) our engineering muscles. We're looking for talented engineers (or fuzzicians as we like to say) to join the team and help grow the business.

We've been working on some great stuff with some highlights including [building smart insoles](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/ai-for-your-feet), [automating document processing in the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1u72UluaPs), data warehousing, and data DevOps. One of the most exciting sectors we're working in right now is medical tech with a FTSE250 medical devices supplier, and on the horizon we're concentrating increasingly on deploying AI models to edge hardware such as Arduino, ARM and Nvidia devices, and working with exotic and emerging sensor technology (we can't say too much but it involves graphene!).

If you happen to be a techie who thinks this all sounds terribly exciting, then maybe you'd like to join us. This is an opportunity for an ambitious software engineer with 1-2 years of experience to become part of a very small, very agile team and to play a pivotal role in shaping this business as it grows.

## What we're looking for:

* We're based in Manchester, but we're a global team and so we're happy to receive applications from around the world.
* Background in computer science, mathematics or a scientific field such as biology, chemistry, physics.
* A demonstrable capability in Python and Go. Additional experience with something 'interesting' like Scala, Haskell, or Rust is great too.
* Experience with our core software tooling is essential, particularly Git, Unix/Linux, Docker, CI/CD.
* Awareness of modern DevOps practices.
* Exposure to cloud computing, for example AWS, Google Cloud or Azure.
* Knowledge of modern machine learning tools and techniques, including neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing and computer vision. Commercial experience is not required, but we're looking for someone who has at least worked through some of the training courses offered by the likes of [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/learn), [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization) or [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) or with equivalent experience.
* Experience, personal or professional, with Jupyter or R studio.
* Knowledge of relational databases such as Postgres or MySql, as well as no-sql databases like MongoDB, Redis, etc. A good understanding of data modelling is essential and experience with cloud-based data warehousing platforms such as Google BigQuery is a bonus.

The most important characteristic is a sense of curiosity that drives you to learn new things, so if you don't tick all the boxes right now, don't let that stop you. We use the most appropriate and up-to-date technology available, so that means you'll need to adapt to change rapidly. Put another way, we're not looking for a technology-x programmer, we're looking for a willing-to-try-anything programmer.

## Responsibilities

This will be a diverse role that welcomes unconventional thinking, creativity and a flexible mindset. As well as writing code and training machine learning models, you'll be given the opportunity to write blogs, speak at events, or feature in vlogs (not mandatory!). You'll participate in business development, project planning and hiring too.

## What are we like?

We can't offer big company stuff; there's no free breakfast or fussball table. There are no fancy corporate job titles (although if you want to call yourself senior vice president of sarcasm, that's fine, and even encouraged).

By joining a small company you'll have the chance to make a real impact on its future. There's plenty of room for growth and we'll work with you to help you realise your technical and personal ambitions because your success and the company's success are one and the same.

As part of our offer you'll also be able to enrol in an employee share scheme after a suitable period (6-12 months), giving you a real stake in the business.

And though there's no free breakfast, we often go out for food and drinks to celebrate our successes and failures (or argue about Emacs vs Vim).

To learn more, take a look at our [Github](https://github.com/fuzzylabs), website, and [blog](https://fuzzylabs.ai/blog).

## Interested?

Don't worry, there's no HR department. If you'd like to work with us, send us a CV and, most importantly, a link to your Github (or Bitbucket, etc). If you've got a [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) account, tech blog, cool side-project, or Instagram account for your cat/dog/etc, send us that too (optional).

Interviews will be relaxed and informal. We'll get together to talk about the tech behind our current projects and then do a little pair-programming.

## No recruiters, no agencies

Dear recruiters: I know, everyone says 'no recruiters'. I'm sure you have this incredible candidate who we just have to talk to. No doubt we're missing out by not listening but for the time being that's the way it has to be; *c'est la vie*.
