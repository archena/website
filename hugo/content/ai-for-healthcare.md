   copy: "<h3>AI in medical technology – the opportunities</h3><p>Wearable medical technology is already changing people’s lives for the better. What’s really exciting is just how much more is possible for biotech firms who embrace data science and AI at every level, to build truly data-driven patient outcomes.</p><p> AI can be applied to life sciences in so many ways. You can speed up manual patient record processing, using automated OCR (optical character recognition) data extraction. Or connect these patient data points from disparate sources using data warehousing. Next? Make new inferences, and build a richer diagnostic picture. Then, use applied AI techniques to analyse, cross reference, and scour medical journals to diagnose and predict patient outcomes.</p><p> Machine learning is not just helping process medical text records either – algorithms can be trained to recognise, understand, and classify medical imagery like X-rays, MRI scans and even photographs of symptoms. Using AI image recognition can augment and improve decision making for clinicians, meaning faster and more accurate diagnoses.</p><p> The possibilities for AI in biotech are huge.  We can make what’s possible, reality.</p>"

      heading: "Develop wearable medical technology"
      description: "<a href='/blog/ai-for-your-feet'>IOT projects using sensors</a> and wearable technology improve people’s lives, and ultimately, promote better health. No matter how big or small your dataset or ambition, we can help you develop the right AI solution. Using personal health data is key to empowering patients. Deploying AI to analyse and interpret IOT data is the next logical step. We’ll help you see the bigger picture, and do so much more with your data."

      heading: "Improve patient outcomes with medical image recognition"
      description: "We’ve built and trained complex algorithms to analyse medical imaging. AI is able to compare medical images across millions of connected data points infinitely faster than a human. It can identify disease markers in seconds. Or suggest a likely diagnosis. AI applications can also cross reference similar past cases, to identify the best course of treatment and likely outcome."

      heading: "Privacy and compliance in medical research"
      description: "We can help further biotech research projects by applying AI, to create differential privacy models for your data. Anonymising data is crucial in healthcare research, and our custom built AI solutions ensure that your patient data is not at risk. Applying machine learning techniques can also reduce the risk of introducing bias in medical research modelling, for more accurate outcomes."
