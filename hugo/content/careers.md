As we approach our first full year at Fuzzy Labs, we're ready to hire more techies (or fuzzicians, as I'm insisting on saying).

We set up Fuzzy Labs because we wanted build cool AI-driven software, to work with the latest tech, and to flex (and grow) our engineering muscles.

It's been a great near-year, with some highlights including [building smart insoles](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/ai-for-your-feet), [automating document processing in the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1u72UluaPs), data warehousing, and data DevOps. One of the most exciting sectors we've got involved with is medical tech, on which there'll be much more to say over the coming months.

If you happen to be a techie who thinks this all sounds terribly exciting, then maybe you'd like to join us as the third member of our team. This is an opportunity for an ambitious software engineer with 1-2 years of experience to join a very small, very agile team and to play a pivotal role in shaping this business as it grows.

## What we're looking for:

* Based in the Greater Manchester area.
* Background in computer science, mathematics or a scientific field such as biology, chemistry, physics.
* A demonstrable capability in Python and Go. Additional experience with something 'interesting' like Scala, Haskell, or Rust is great too.
* Experience with core software tooling: Git, Unix/Linux, Docker, CI/CD.
* Awareness of modern DevOps practices.
* Exposure to cloud computing, for example AWS, Google Cloud or Azure.
* Knowledge of modern machine learning tools and techniques, including neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing and computer vision. Commercial experience is not required, but we're looking for someone who has at least worked through some of the training courses offered by the likes of [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/learn/), [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) or [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/).
* Experience, personal or professional, with Jupyter or R studio.
* Experience with relational databases such as Postgres or MySql, as well as no-sql databases like MongoDB, Redis, etc. A good understanding of data modelling is essential and experience with cloud-based data warehousing platforms such as Google BigQuery is a bonus.

But rather than ticking all the boxes it's important that you have a sense of curiosity that drives you to learn new things. We use the most appropriate and up-to-date technology available, so that means you'll need to adapt to change rapidly. Put another way, we're not looking for a technology-x programmer, we're looking for a willing-to-try-anything programmer.

## Responsibilities

This will be a diverse role that welcomes unconventional thinking, creativity and a flexible mindset. As well as writing code and training machine learning models, you'll be given the opportunity to write blogs, speak at events, or feature in vlogs (not mandatory!). You'll participate in business development, project planning and hiring too.

## What are we like?

We can't offer big company stuff; there's no free breakfast or fussball table. There are no fancy corporate job titles (although if you want to call yourself senior vice president of sarcasm, that's fine, and even encouraged).

By joining a small company you'll have the chance to make a real impact on its future. The successful candidate should expect to be leading the engineering team in a few years. Your success and the company's success are one and the same.

As part of our offer you'll also be able to enrol in an employee share scheme after a suitable period (6-12 months), giving you a real stake in the business.

And though there's no free breakfast, we often go out for food and drinks to celebrate our successes and failures (or argue about Emacs vs Vim).

To learn more, take a look at our [Github](https://github.com/fuzzylabs), website, and [blog](https://fuzzylabs.ai/blog).

## Interested?

Don't worry, there's no HR department. If you'd like to work with us, send us a CV and, more importantly, a link to your Github (or Bitbucket, etc). If you've got a [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) account, tech blog, cool side-project, or Instagram account for your cat/dog/etc, send us that too (optional).

Interviews will be relaxed and informal. We'll get together to talk about the tech behind our current projects and then do a little pair-programming.

## No recruiters, no agencies

Dear recruiters: I know, everyone says 'no recruiters'. I'm sure you have this incredible candidate who we just have to talk to. No doubt we're missing out by not listening but for the time being that's the way it has to be; c'est la vie.
