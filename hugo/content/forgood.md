We believe in *AI for everybody*, and part of that means using AI to benefit people's lives and to improve our communities. As well as ensuring that the things we build don't harm people or the environment, we also want to create things that make a difference to people.

## Community initiative

We're inviting people to get involved in a community project that demonstrates the use of AI and data to make our world a better place. This could be tackling homelessness or poverty, contributing to wildlife conservation, improving our understanding of climate change, or something else that we haven't thought of yet. We're keen to work with other tech companies, non-profits and individual experts (not necessarily AI experts!) to make these projects a reality.

If you're interested in getting involved, if you have an idea or just want to know more please get in touch through [talk@fuzzylabs.ai](mailto:talk@fuzzylabs.ai).
