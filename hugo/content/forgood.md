title: AI for Good
---
When we came up with our slogan 'AI for everybody' we didn't do this as just a marketing ploy. Whilst we are a commercial business, we didn't want to focus our efforts on purely working with commercial customers.

We genuinely believe and care that AI should be used in a positive way to benefit the lives of as many people as possible. To that end, Fuzzy Labs are committed to investing 20% of our time in non commercial work that makes effective use of AI on projects that encourage positive social change. These projects will promote the ethical side of AI and show that it isn't scary. Robots aren't going to (completely) take over!

We'd like these projects to have a strong community focus in our city. Manchester has a strong heritage with much to be proud of. looking around the city at the number of cranes it is obvious that we're entering a new period of growth. But with growth comes challenges that need to be identified and addressed.  The number of homeless people on our streets is an obvious one, most of us are unsure how to help but what if we could all do something small that made a big impact? Transport is clearly a concern, with more and more people living and working in the city, how do we get where we need to safely and reliably. Ebikes are great, but you've still got to dodge all the cement mixers that seem to be continuously running in and out of the city. And what about the bees? We've all got the tattoos and pictures of them stuck in our car windows but where are they going to live in our city as development increases and habitats are destroyed?

We believe that projects benefiting the community should be worked on by the community. We'll be looking to invite other tech companies in Manchester to get involved and help turn these projects into reality. The code for these projects will be entirely open source so we'll be welcoming contributions to this as well as forming a core group to determine the priorities of the work and help to promote it.

If you'd like to find out more or are keen to get involved then please get in touch - talk@fuzzylabs.ai.

Thanks.
